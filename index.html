                        I used my family's business website as a starting point to improve its accessibility. One of the improvements made was to change the fonts,
                        colors, and button designs to improve visibility. Other improvements consisted of small layout changes and having the announcements in it's
                        own section so it's always visible. The web page was created using HTML and CSS
