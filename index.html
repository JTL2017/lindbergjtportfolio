                        I used my family's business website as a starting point to improve its accessibility. One of the improvements made was to change the fonts,
                        colors, and button designs to improve visibility. Other improvements consisted of small layout changes and having the announcements in it's
                        own section so it's always visible. The web page was created using HTML and CSS

                     The website consists of travels that I share. It allows viewers to click on articles to view the trips that I've been to. 
                     The website was created using WordPress.

                        Which includes different documentation papers and Adobe XD prototypes. My specific tasks included the incorporation of the menu and cart system. 
                        The menu was incorporated with PHP and a MySql database. The front end consisted of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
